                    if you are looking to stand apart from others. Only a good sense of clothing and style is not enough
                    to make a difference. Instead, you need to focus on your shoes and make an impression that will last
                    for a long time.
                    <br>Even if you are not wearing the best clothes that arenâ€™t in trend anymore, a good pair of shoes
                    will elevate your look in a few seconds. They will quickly shift the focus from your dress to your
                    feet and make you the star of the party.
